VolunApp is an App that help people to search any event in KAMI community by their interest and passion, people can be a part of volunteering team and make impact together.


## Basic Research:
Komunitas Anak Muda Indonesia (KAMI) was established in 2015 by 5 youths to create a positive impact to the society. Acknowledging there are many people who need care and compassion, they created Birthday in a Box (BIB). Volunteer is one of the most important aspect in KAMI. There are many registered volunteer but only few of them join the volunteering activities. From our findings, some volunteers state they are bored with the same repetitive volunteering activities. We also see an opportunity that society is interested in KAMI and their volunteering activities. They want to join the volunteering activities but they are not willing to register as KAMI volunteer member as it requires long term commitment.
